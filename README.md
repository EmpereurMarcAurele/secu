######exploit_work.sh
work on ubuntu 14.04; for the moment, VM go successfully root from restricted privileges but crash few second after
       My thought is typage isn't good, need replace "int, long and char' with something like "int8_t".
             For the few seconds i'm root, i can read /etc/shadow
